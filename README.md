## 📌 Overview
This assignment demonstrates the use of **predefined front-end templates** to solve mathematical problems from:
- Trigonometry
- Simple & Compound Interest

The templates provide structured layouts with:
- Number boxes
- Variable boxes
- Fraction boxes
- Highlight boxes
- Pre-set arrows and logical flow

---

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **Template1/** → Contains problems solved using Template 1 (Trigonometry / Linear arithmetic).
- **Template2/** → Contains problems solved using Template 2 (Compound Interest / Interest growth).
- **Screenshots/** → Each template folder has a subfolder containing screenshots of rendered outputs.

---

## 📝 Instructions Followed
1. Selected questions from Trigonometry & Compound Interest.  
2. Used **Template 1** for linear/arithmetic problems.  
3. Used **Template 2** for power/repeated multiplication/interest problems.  
4. Replaced only numbers, variables, and steps inside `<div>` blocks.  
5. Did **not** modify CSS or template structure.  
6. Maintained logical flow using arrows, fractions, and highlight boxes.  

---

## 📌 Deliverables
✅ **2 problems solved using Template 1** (Trigonometry).  
✅ **2 problems solved using Template 2** (Compound Interest).  
✅ **Screenshots attached** for each solution.
